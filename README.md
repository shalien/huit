# Huit

A study project for writing a webserver in Dart without using shelf because... reasons.

The purpose of Huit is to provide a simple, reliable way to write a webserver in Dart in the same way Laravel does it for PHP.

The main focus will be around the route system (handling requests and responses), serving static files and providing a simple templating system. 

For the foreseable future, I don't plan on adding an ORM or database related features.


## Roadmap
 1. The "server"
 2. The "routes" system 
 3. The "Template Engine"
